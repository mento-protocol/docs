# On-and-Offramp Providers

If you don't want to use centralized exchanges and on-ramp crypto assets directly into your decentralized non-custodial wallet, you can use several on-ramp providers to do so.&#x20;

With on-ramp providers, you can buy Mento stable assets directly with a credit card or from a bank account. You will need to create an account and provide identity identification before you can use their services.&#x20;

For example, these providers offer direct access to USDm: [MoonPay](https://www.moonpay.com/buy), [Ramp](https://ramp.network/buy), [Bitmama](https://bitmama.io/), [Paychant](https://paychant.com/buy-crypto), [Cashramp](https://cashramp.co/), [Fonbnk](https://fonbnk.com/) and [Banxa](https://banxa.com/).
