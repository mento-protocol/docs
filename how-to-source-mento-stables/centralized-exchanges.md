# CEXs, DEXs, Pools

## Centralized Exchanges

Mento stable assets and collateral cryptocurrencies trade on several centralized exchanges (CEXs). CEXs are a good way to get started with crypto and to on-ramp or off-ramp to and from the fiat money world, for example, the US Dollar or the Euro. To use centralized exchange services, you will have to create an account and provide identity verification.

A good way to find out where an asset is trading is [Coinmarketcap.com.](https://coinmarketcap.com/)

As an example, for the Celo Dollar, you can go to the [_Celo Dollar Markets_](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/celo-dollar/) section on [Coinmarketcap.com](https://coinmarketcap.com) and view a list of available exchanges.

## Decentralized Exchanges

Decentralized exchanges (DEXs) are the primary way of exchanging assets in the decentralized finance (DeFi) community. There are multiple DEXs on Celo where you can exchange Mento stable assets:

* [Uniswap](https://app.uniswap.org/#/swap)
* [Curve](https://curve.fi/#/celo/swap)
* [Sushi](https://www.sushi.com/swap?fromChainId=42220)
* [Ubeswap](https://app.ubeswap.org/#/swap)
* [Carbon DeFi](https://app.carbondefi.xyz/trade)



## Mento Asset Exchange

The [Mento web app](https://app.mento.org/) is a direct gateway to the Mento Platform. The web app is maintained by the Mento Labsâ€™ core team and allows the exchange of stable assets with collateral assets. Depending on the direction of the trade, stable assets are either created or burned directly by the Mento Reserve.

Please be aware, that for large orders against non-USDC collateral assets for cUSD and non-EUROC assets for cEUR, slippage might increase since the mechanism protects itself against oracle manipulation risk. For larger amounts, USDC and EUROC pairs on Mento or the high-liquidity Curve pool are good places to trade.

## High-liquidity Curve Pool for cUSD

The Mento reserve maintains a [high-liquidity Curve pool](https://curve.fi/#/celo/pools/factory-v2-35/deposit) with 20 million USD in liquidity, split between cUSD and USDCet. USDCet is USDC bridged from Ethereum via [Wormhole](https://wormhole.com/) and the [Portal Token Bridge](https://www.portalbridge.com/#/transfer)
