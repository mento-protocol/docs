### Stability Analysis for Mento Stable Assets

The **Stability Analysis** provides a comprehensive examination of the stability characteristics of Mento's stable assets through robust simulations under diverse market conditions. The goal is to understand how the protocol behaves and to identify potential vulnerabilities across a wide range of scenarios, including:&#x20;

* Severe market shocks
* Adversarial attacks
* Extreme positive and negative market movements

With this approach, we simulated various scenarios rather than relying solely on historical data, given the nascent state of crypto markets. By modeling a broad spectrum of possibilities, our analysis maintains a resilient framework for Mento stable assets.
