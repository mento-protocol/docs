#### How to engage with Mento governance?

To engage with Mento governance, users can visit https://governance.mento.org/ and lock their Mento, view their voting power, and participate in Mento governance proposals.&#x20;

Via [CGP#180 “Mento Spin-off and Launch of the MENTO token”](https://mondo.celo.org/governance/cgp-139), the Celo Community approved the transfer of governance over the Mento Protocol (smart contract, reserve, etc.) from CELO to MENTO token holders.

The MENTO governance token ($MENTO) is an ERC-20 token on the Celo blockchain. Users can lock MENTO tokens to receive veMENTO, which grants voting power for protocol proposals. The longer tokens are locked, the greater the voting power, using the ve-Token model inspired by Curve Finance.⁠

⁠​Key on-chain governance components include:

* Governor contract: Allows veMENTO holders to create and vote on proposals.⁠
* ⁠⁠⁠​Governance Executor: Executes approved proposals after a timelock.
* Watchdog Multisig: Serves as a guardian of last resort, able to veto malicious proposals.⁠
* ⁠⁠⁠​Proxy Admin: Enables upgrades of core protocol contracts.⁠

Governance users can use [governance.mento.org](https://governance.mento.org/), where they can view balances, create and vote on proposals.⁠

General decisions, treasury management, reserve allocations, and protocol parameter changes are now made via governance proposals submitted by token holders.⁠
