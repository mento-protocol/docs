# From Other Chains

Bridge assets from other blockchains to Celo and swap them for Mento stables. This guide covers the main bridging options and step-by-step instructions for obtaining cUSD, cEUR, cREAL, and eXOF from external chains.

## Overview

To get Mento stables from other chains, you'll typically:

1. Bridge assets (like USDC, ETH, or other tokens) to Celo
2. Swap the bridged assets for Mento stables using the Mento protocol or DEXs

The most common path is bridging USDC and then swapping it 1:1 for cUSD through Mento.

## Squid Router

SquidRouter V2 serves as an easy tool to access Mento stables. It allows you to mint and redeem Mento stables with other Celo assets and assets on various other blockchains. Squid also enables cross-chain swaps.

### Key Features

* **One-click cross-chain swaps**: Get Mento stables directly from any supported chain
* **Wide chain support**: Works with Ethereum, Arbitrum, Polygon, BSC, and 20+ other chains

### How to Use Squid

1. Visit [app.squidrouter.com](https://app.squidrouter.com/)
2. Connect your wallet
3. Select source chain and token (e.g., USDC on Ethereum)
4. Select Celo as destination chain
5. Choose your desired Mento stable (cUSD, cEUR, etc.)
6. Review rates and fees
7. Approve and execute the swap

## Portal Bridge (Wormhole)

You can also bridge using the the Portal Token Bridge powered by the Wormhole protocol.

### How to Bridge with Portal

1. Go to [portalbridge.com](https://portalbridge.com/)
2. Connect your wallet
3. Select source network (e.g., Ethereum)
4. Select Celo as target network
5. Choose token and amount
6. Approve token spending
7. Complete the bridge transaction

Tokens bridged using the Portal bridge will arrive in your wallet within a few minutes after completing the transaction.

### After Bridging

Once your tokens arrive on Celo:

* Swap to Mento stables on [app.mento.org](https://app.mento.org/)
* Or use DEXs like Uniswap, Curve, or Ubeswap

## Multichain Future with Wormhole NTT

Mento is expanding its decentralized onchain FX capabilities to other blockchains by [integrating with Wormhole](https://www.mento.org/blog/mento-selects-wormhole-as-its-official-interoperability-provider-to-power-multichain-fx) and its Native Token Transfers (NTT) standard. This will enable:

* Movement of multi-currency stablecoins across 40+ blockchains with native issuance and redemption
* Multichain FX trading between 17+ stablecoins (including USDT and USDC) with real-time price execution
* Direct Mento stable access on multiple chains without bridging to Celo first

## Best Practices

### Compare Options

* **For specific tokens**: Check which bridge supports your asset
* **For best rates**: Compare fees between bridges

### Security Tips

* Always verify bridge URLs before connecting
* Start with small test amounts
* Check recipient addresses on Celo explorer
* Keep some CELO for gas fees

### Gas Considerations

* Bridge fees vary by network congestion
* Factor in both source chain and Celo fees
