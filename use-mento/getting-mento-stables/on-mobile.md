## Security Considerations

Both wallets are self-custodial, meaning:

* You control your private keys
* No third party can access your funds
* Backup mechanisms protect against device loss
* Biometric authentication for transactions

## Best Practices

1. **Always verify recipient numbers** before sending
2. **Keep your recovery method secure** (seed phrase for Valora, Google account for MiniPay)
3. **Start with small amounts** when testing new features
4. **Enable biometric security** for transaction approval
5. **Regular backups** of your wallet credentials
