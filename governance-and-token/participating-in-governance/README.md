# Participating in Governance

## Introduction

Mento governance puts the protocol's future in the hands of its community. Through on-chain voting, MENTO token holders directly influence protocol parameters, treasury allocations, and strategic direction.

The governance process is designed to be transparent, secure, and accessible. By locking MENTO tokens to receive veMENTO (vote-escrowed MENTO), participants gain voting power proportional to their commitment to the protocol's long-term success.

## How Governance Works

Mento uses a decentralized governance model where:

* **veMENTO** holders vote on all protocol changes and propose new ones.
* **Proposals** follow a structured lifecycle from forum discussion to on-chain execution
* **Watchdogs** provide security oversight with veto power
* **Time delays** ensure transparency and allow for community review

Whether you want to vote on existing proposals or create your own, the governance system provides clear pathways for participation at every level.

## Getting Started

Your governance journey typically follows these steps:

1. **Acquire voting power** by locking MENTO for veMENTO
2. **Participate in discussions** on the governance forum
3. **Vote on proposals** that shape the protocol
4. **Create proposals** to implement your ideas

Each aspect of governance has its own guide to help you participate effectively.
