# Overview

Mento operates as a fully decentralized protocol governed by its community. Unlike traditional financial systems where central authorities make decisions, Mento distributes decision-making power among MENTO token holders who have a direct stake in the protocol's success.

The governance system builds on proven DeFi governance models while introducing unique features tailored to Mento's needs:

* **On-chain execution**: All governance decisions execute automatically through smart contracts
* **Transparent process**: Proposals, discussions, and votes are public and verifiable
* **Time-locked implementation**: Changes include delay periods for security review
* **Emergency safeguards**: Watchdog mechanisms protect against malicious proposals

This decentralized approach ensures no single entity controls the protocol, creating a resilient system that serves its users' collective interests.

### **Core Governance Principles**

Mento governance operates on several foundational principles:

**Community Ownership**: The protocol belongs to its users and stakeholders. Major decisions require community consensus through formal voting processes.

**Progressive Decentralization**: While fully decentralized at the protocol level, governance started with training wheels (like the watchdog multisig) that can be removed as the system matures.

**Informed Decision-Making**: Proposals include detailed specifications, risk assessments, and implementation plans to enable educated voting.

**Aligned Incentives**: The veMENTO (vote-escrowed MENTO) model rewards long-term thinking by giving more voting power to tokens locked for longer periods.

### **What Is Being Governed**

Mento governance controls all aspects of the protocol's operation and evolution:

#### **Protocol Parameters**

* **Fee structures**: Trading fees, rebalancing incentives, and in the future, protocol revenue distribution
* **Risk parameters**: Trading limits and circuit breaker thresholds
* **Pool configuration**: Adding new trading pairs, adjusting pool parameters

#### **Oracle Management**

* **Provider selection**: Approving and removing oracle data providers
* **Feed configuration**: Setting rate feed IDs and update thresholds
* **Quality standards**: Defining accuracy requirements and deviation limits

#### **Technical Upgrades**

* **Smart contract updates**: Implementing new features and optimizations
* **Security patches**: Addressing vulnerabilities through coordinated upgrades
* **Integration approvals**: Connecting with new chains, bridges, or protocols

#### **Economic Policy**

* **Emission target**: Managing MENTO token distribution
* **Liquidity programs**: Incentivizing pool participation and ecosystem growth

#### **Governance Evolution**

* **Process improvements**: Refining proposal and voting mechanisms
* **Parameter adjustments**: Modifying quorum requirements or voting periods
* **Delegation features**: Enabling more flexible participation models

### Governance Process

The typical governance flow follows these stages:

1. **Community Discussion**: Ideas emerge and refine through forum discussions
2. **Formal Proposal**: Detailed specifications submitted on-chain
3. **Voting Period**: Token holders cast votes over several days
4. **Timelock Delay**: Approved proposals wait before execution for security review
5. **Implementation**: Execution of approved changes can be triggered by anyone via the interface

Each stage includes safeguards and requirements to ensure high-quality decisions while maintaining efficiency.

### **Participation Levels**

Governance accommodates different levels of involvement:

**Passive Participants**: Can delegate voting power to active community members they trust.

**Active Voters**: Review proposals and vote directly on changes they care about.

**Proposal Authors**: Draft and submit governance proposals for community consideration.

**Core Contributors**: Provide technical analysis and implementation support for complex changes.

**Watchdog Members:** Serve as the final security layer, with veto power over proposals that are malicious or incorrectly implemented.

All participants benefit from the protocol's success, creating natural alignment between individual and collective interests.

### **Evolution and Maturity**

Mento governance is designed to evolve. Initial safeguards like the watchdog multisig provide security during early stages but can be removed or modified as the system demonstrates stability. This progressive decentralization ensures both immediate safety and long-term autonomy.

The governance system itself is governed, the community can vote to improve processes, adjust parameters, or implement new features that enhance participation and decision quality.
