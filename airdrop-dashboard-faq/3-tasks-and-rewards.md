# **Tasks and Rewards**

### **How are the tasks structured?**

Tasks are divided into two ports:

* Socials Port: Engagement on platforms like Discord and Twitter  
* Traders Port: On-chain activities like trading and providing liquidity

### **What happens if I miss tasks from a previous month?**

Each season (month) has its own set of tasks. While you can't complete tasks from previous seasons, new seasons bring new opportunities to earn M-Score.

### **Is there a maximum amount of M-Score I can earn?**

There isnâ€™t a fixed cap for the M-Score. The total you can earn depends on your participation across the various activities and tasks available on the dashboard.
