# The Reserve

The Mento Reserve holds and manages the collateral assets that back Mento stablecoins. It serves as the protocol's treasury, ensuring that stable assets remain fully collateralized while enabling efficient liquidity management across the ecosystem.

## Purpose and Function

The Reserve acts as the central collateral pool for the Mento protocol. When users mint stablecoins, they deposit collateral into the Reserve. When they redeem stablecoins, they withdraw collateral from the Reserve. This mechanism ensures that every stablecoin in circulation has corresponding backing.

Unlike traditional stablecoin reserves that may be opaque or centrally controlled, the Mento Reserve operates transparently on-chain. All holdings, transactions, and collateralization ratios are publicly verifiable through smart contracts and blockchain data.

## Collateral Composition

The Reserve holds a diversified portfolio of crypto assets to minimize risk and ensure stability. Current collateral types include:

* **Stablecoins**: USDC, USDT, and USDS provide stable value and high liquidity
* **Crypto assets**: BTC, ETH and other cryptocurrencies offer growth potential and ecosystem alignment
* **Yield-bearing assets**: Assets that generate returns while serving as collateral

This multi-asset approach reduces dependency on any single collateral type. If one asset experiences issues, others can maintain the protocol's solvency.

## Over-Collateralization

The Reserve maintains collateralization ratios above 100% to protect against market volatility. This buffer ensures that even during significant market downturns, the protocol can honor all redemptions at the target exchange rate.

The collateralization ratio represents the total USD value of reserve assets divided by the total USD value of all outstanding Mento stablecoins. This aggregate approach provides a comprehensive view of the protocol's solvency across all stable assets rather than tracking individual ratios per stablecoin.

A higher ratio indicates stronger backing and more protection against market volatility, while efficient capital usage requires balancing security with practical constraints. The protocol maintains this balance to ensure both stability and sustainability.

## Reserve Management

The Reserve operates autonomously through smart contracts, with key functions including:

**Asset Allocation**: Governance can adjust the target composition of reserve assets to optimize for stability, yield, and risk. Rebalancing happens gradually to minimize market impact.

**Revenue Generation**: Reserve assets can be deployed to generate yield through low-risk strategies. Returns flow back to the protocol, benefiting MENTO stakers and strengthening the reserve.

**Risk Management**: Automated systems monitor collateralization ratios and asset health. If ratios fall below thresholds, protective mechanisms activate to restore proper backing.

## Transparency and Verification

All Reserve operations are transparent and verifiable:

* Real-time reserve composition available at [reserve.mento.org](https://reserve.mento.org/?tab=reserve-holdings)
* On-chain proof of reserves through smart contract queries
* Open-source contracts enabling independent verification

This transparency builds trust and allows market participants to make informed decisions about using Mento stablecoins.

## The Reserve Safety Fund

A portion of the Reserve is allocated to [the Safety Fund](https://forum.celo.org/t/mento-spin-off-and-launch-of-the-mento-token/7747), an additional buffer against extreme events. This fund, denominated in MENTO tokens, provides last-resort backing if primary collateral suffers losses through:

* Smart contract exploits
* Collateral token failures
* Extreme market events
* Other black swan scenarios

The Safety Fund represents the protocol's commitment to maintaining stablecoin backing even in worst-case scenarios.

## Governance and Control

The Reserve operates under decentralized governance through the MENTO token. No single entity can unilaterally access or redirect reserve assets. Key decisions require community approval:

* Adding or removing collateral types
* Adjusting target allocations
* Implementing new yield strategies
* Modifying risk parameters

This governance structure ensures the Reserve serves the long-term interests of the protocol and its users rather than any individual party.

## Integration with Protocol Components

The Reserve connects with other protocol components to enable stability:

* Provides collateral for stablecoin minting and redemption
* Sources assets for liquidity pool rebalancing
* Generates revenue that funds protocol operations
* Maintains buffers that enable trading during volatility

These integrations create a cohesive system where the Reserve's health directly supports overall protocol stability.
