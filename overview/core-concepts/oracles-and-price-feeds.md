# Oracles & Price Feeds

Oracles provide the real-world price data that enables Mento's stability mechanisms. They feed accurate exchange rates to the protocol, allowing stablecoins to maintain their pegs through arbitrage and fixed-price swaps.

## How Mento Oracles Work

Mento uses a decentralized oracle system where multiple independent data providers report prices on-chain. The protocol aggregates these reports to determine reliable exchange rates while protecting against manipulation or faulty data.

The oracle system consists of three main components:

**Data Providers**: Independent entities that source exchange rates from various markets. Each provider monitors real-world FX rates and cryptocurrency prices.

**Oracle Relayers**: Services that collect reports from data providers and submit them on-chain. Relayers batch multiple reports together to save gas while ensuring timely price updates.

**On-Chain Contracts**: Smart contracts that verify reports, aggregate prices, and make them available to the protocol. These contracts maintain sorted lists of prices and timestamps from each oracle provider.

## Price Aggregation

When oracle reports arrive on-chain, the protocol doesn't simply use individual prices. Instead, it employs multiple layers of aggregation and validation:

**Sorted Lists**: Each rate feed maintains sorted linked lists of reported values and their timestamps. This structure enables efficient median calculation and expired report removal.

**Median Calculation**: The protocol takes the median of all valid reports, reducing the impact of outliers or manipulated values. The median updates automatically as new reports arrive or old ones expire.

**Report Expiry**: Reports older than the configured expiry time (set per rate feed or using a global default) are considered stale and can be removed, ensuring only fresh data influences prices.

## Oracle Providers

Mento integrates with established oracle networks to ensure reliable price feeds:

**Chainlink**: Industry-standard decentralized oracles with large node networks and proven reliability across DeFi protocols.

**RedStone**: Fast, gas-efficient oracle infrastructure that enables high-frequency updates with lower costs.

The protocol can integrate additional oracle providers through governance, ensuring no single point of failure in price discovery.

## Rate Feed IDs

Rate feed identifiers are the report targets for oracles. They feature in governance proposals mainly for:

1. Whitelisting oracles to report for a rate feed
2. Setting reference rates for exchanges
3. Configuring circuit breakers in the BreakerBox

## Quality Assurance

Multiple mechanisms ensure oracle data quality:

**Oracle Authorization**: Each oracle must be explicitly added to a rate feed's whitelist through governance. Only authorized oracles can submit reports.

**Automatic Expiry**: Old reports are automatically invalidated after the expiry period, preventing stale data from affecting current prices.

**Median Filtering**: Using the median rather than average prices provides natural resistance to manipulation, as an attacker would need to control multiple oracles to shift the median significantly.

## Integration with Protocol

Oracle prices flow through the protocol to enable core functions:

1. **Price Discovery**: Exchange contracts query median rates to determine swap prices(â„¹consider footnote to clarify what exchange contract is(family of contrtacts vs V1 contract). The broad term makes sense)
2. **Circuit Breaker Monitoring**: The circuit breaker checks oracle updates for abnormal movements
3. **Multi-Asset Support**: Different rate feeds track various currency pairs and asset prices

## Technical Architecture

The oracle system uses gas-optimized designs for efficiency:

**Sorted Linked Lists**: Enable O(1) median calculation while maintaining sorted order for efficient updates.

**Batch Updates**: Oracles can update prices in a single transaction, with automatic median recalculation.

**Modular Design**: Oracle management, price aggregation, and breaker integration are cleanly separated for maintainability.

**Event Emission**: All significant actions emit events for off-chain monitoring and indexing.

## Oracle Governance

Oracle system parameters are managed through decentralized governance:

* Adding or removing oracle providers
* Setting report expiry times
* Managing equivalent token mappings
* Configuring rate feed parameters

This ensures the oracle system evolves with the protocol's needs while maintaining decentralization.
