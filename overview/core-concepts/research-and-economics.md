# Research & Economics

The Mento Protocol represents a fundamental rethinking of how on-chain foreign exchange can work. By combining oracle-driven pricing with automated inventory management, Mento creates a system where stability emerges from aligned economic incentives rather than algorithmic supply controls.

## Economic Foundations

Mento's economics rest on three pillars:

**Arbitrage-Driven Stability**: Price deviations create profit opportunities that naturally restore pegs. When market prices drift from targets, rational actors are incentivized to correct them.

**Capital Efficiency**: Fixed-price trading concentrates liquidity where it's needed most, at the real exchange rate. This delivers deep liquidity without the massive capital requirements of traditional AMMs.

**Sustainable Incentives**: Every participant, from arbitrageurs to liquidity providers, can profit from their role in maintaining the system. This creates a robust, self-reinforcing ecosystem.
