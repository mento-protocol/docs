# What Is Mento?

Mento is a decentralized, multi-currency stable asset protocol built for creating and exchanging stablecoins without relying on centralized intermediaries. At its core is a set of audited smart contracts designed for transparency, decentralization, and capital efficiency, enabling Mento to operate as the most robust onchain foreign exchange (FX) infrastructure.

Unlike traditional fiat-backed stablecoins or fully algorithmic systems, Mento uses a **hybrid stability model**. Each stable asset is backed by a diversified, over-collateralized reserve of digital assets and stabilized through automated market operations. This includes smart contract-based minting, redemption, and price targeting, augmented by **on-chain circuit breakers** and **daily trading limits** that guard against volatility, oracle manipulation, or liquidity crises.

Mento currently supports 15+ stablecoins representing currencies from around the world. All assets are minted and redeemed **permissionlessly**, assuming the underlying blockchain infrastructure is functional. Governance is decentralized and driven by holders of the MENTO token.

The protocol is designed to bring FX-grade stability to decentralized finance without sacrificing transparency, resilience, or global accessibility.

### How Does the Mento Protocol Compare to Traditional Stablecoin Systems?

To understand how Mento differs from traditional stablecoin systems, it helps to examine two areas: the distinction between hybrid and fiat-backed models, and the contrast between single-currency versus multi-currency platforms.

### Fiat-Backed vs Hybrid Stability

Most stablecoins on the market follow a fiat-backed model, where each token is backed 1:1 by traditional currency held in bank accounts managed by centralized entities. While familiar, this setup relies heavily on trusted intermediaries, lacks transparency, and often comes with geographic or regulatory limitations.

The Mento protocol takes a fundamentally different approach. It uses a **hybrid stability model** that combines:

**Over-collateralized Reserves**: The protocol maintains an over-collateralized ratio across a diversified basket of assets including CELO, BTC, ETH, USDC, and DAI. This substantial over-collateralization provides robust backing during market volatility.

**Elastic Supply Management**: When demand increases (price above peg), users can mint new stablecoins by depositing collateral, and when demand decreases (price below peg), users can burn stablecoins to receive collateral. This creates natural arbitrage opportunities that help maintain price stability.

**Comprehensive Safety Systems:** The protocol includes multiple layers of protection:

* Circuit breakers that automatically halt trading during unusual price movements
* Trading limits that prevent market manipulation through volume restrictions
* Oracle safety mechanisms using multiple independent price feeds with median aggregation
* Emergency controls for extreme market conditions

This hybrid design provides the transparency and permissionless access of DeFi, while incorporating proven safeguards to deliver dependable, stable assets at a global scale.

### Single-Currency vs Multi-Currency Platform

While most stablecoin protocols concentrate on a single currency, usually USD, Mento is designed as a comprehensive, multi-currency FX infrastructure. This unlocks several key advantages:

* Localized stable assets tailored for global users
* Direct currency exchanges without needing USD as an intermediary
* Reduced friction for cross-border payments
* Native support for emerging market currencies underserved by traditional crypto

### Permissionless Systems

Mento is built around permissionless access and transparency, the core principles in DeFi. Anyone can interact with the protocol freely. There are no gatekeepers. No KYC. No geo-restrictions. This is a hard break from how traditional financial systems operate.

With Mento, anyone can:

* Mint or redeem stable assets
* Participate in governance
* Build applications on top of the protocol

Governance is driven by MENTO token holders through transparent onchain voting. All reserve holdings are fully visible onchain. This ensures decisions are made by the community, not centralized actors, and provides a level of transparency that far exceeds traditional finance or even most crypto projects.
