# OracleAdapter

The **OracleAdapter** is the single interface the FPMM pool uses to obtain the swap rate. It returns a rate only when it is **valid**; otherwise it reverts. Validity combines: **recency** of the feed, **trading mode** from BreakerBox (e.g. trading suspended when a breaker has tripped), and, for FX pairs, **FX market hours**. The pool calls `getFXRateIfValid(rateFeedID)` on every quote and swap; if the adapter reverts, the swap path reverts.

This matters for fiat FX feeds because the reference markets are not 24/7: Chainlink FX rates typically stop updating on weekends and certain holidays, and Mento mirrors that by rejecting FX-priced swaps when the configured market-hours breaker says the market is closed.

## Using the OracleAdapter (code examples)

Most integrations **do not** call the OracleAdapter directly: the [FPMM](fpmm.md) pool calls it for every `getAmountOut` and `swap`. Use the adapter directly when you need to **check rate validity** (e.g. before showing a quote in a UI) or **read the current rate** for off-chain logic.

### Getting a valid rate (for swaps / quoting)

If you are implementing custom swap logic and need the same rate the pool would use, call the same method the pool uses. Reverts if FX market is closed, trading is suspended, or the rate is stale:

```solidity
IOracleAdapter adapter = IOracleAdapter(adapterAddress);
address rateFeedID = referenceRateFeedID; // e.g. pool’s referenceRateFeedID

(uint256 numerator, uint256 denominator) = adapter.getFXRateIfValid(rateFeedID);
// Rate = numerator / denominator (e.g. token1 per token0, 1e18 scale)
```

### Checking validity without using the rate

Useful to decide whether to show “trading available” or “market closed / suspended”:

```solidity
try adapter.ensureRateValid(rateFeedID) {
    // Rate is valid; safe to quote/swap
} catch {
    // TradingSuspended, NoRecentRate, or (for getFXRateIfValid) FXMarketClosed
}
```

### Inspecting rate and status (no revert)

Get the raw rate and flags without reverting. Use for dashboards or conditional logic:

```solidity
IOracleAdapter.RateInfo memory info = adapter.getRate(rateFeedID);
// info.numerator, info.denominator
// info.tradingMode  == 0 means bidirectional (trading allowed)
// info.isRecent     == true if within report expiry
// info.isFXMarketOpen
```

## State

| Field | Meaning |
|-------|--------|
| `sortedOracles` | Source contract from which the adapter reads the current Chainlink-backed rate and timestamp for a given `rateFeedID`. |
| `breakerBox` | Provides **trading mode** per rate feed (e.g. bidirectional vs suspended). |
| `marketHoursBreaker` | Provides **FX market open/closed** for the current block timestamp. |
| `l2SequencerUptimeFeed` | Optional Chainlink L2 sequencer feed; if set, can be used to gate on sequencer uptime. |

## Rate feed ID

Each price feed is identified by a **rateFeedID** (an address). For CELO/cStable the ID is the stable token address. For other pairs (e.g. USDC/USD, EUR/USD) the ID is typically derived as `address(uint160(uint256(keccak256(abi.encodePacked(asset0, asset1)))))`. Relayed Chainlink feeds often use a prefix (e.g. `"relayed:PHPUSD"`). The FPMM pool stores a `referenceRateFeedID` and passes it to the adapter.

---

## Main entrypoints (for the pool)

- **getFXRateIfValid(rateFeedID)** — Returns `(numerator, denominator)` only if:  
  1. **FX market is open** (`marketHoursBreaker.isFXMarketOpen(block.timestamp)`).  
  2. **Trading mode** for this feed is bidirectional (`breakerBox.getRateFeedTradingMode(rateFeedID) == TRADING_MODE_BIDIRECTIONAL`).  
  3. **Recent rate:** `medianTimestamp(rateFeedID) >= block.timestamp - reportExpiry` (report expiry comes from `sortedOracles.getTokenReportExpirySeconds(rateFeedID)`).  
  Otherwise reverts with `FXMarketClosed`, `TradingSuspended`, or `NoRecentRate`.

  In the current `MarketHoursBreaker`, FX is treated as closed from **Friday 21:00 UTC** until **Sunday 23:00 UTC**, on **Dec 25** and **Jan 1**, and after **22:00 UTC** on **Dec 24** and **Dec 31**.

- **getRateIfValid(rateFeedID)** — Same as above but **does not** check FX market hours. Used when market-hours gating is not required.

- **ensureRateValid(rateFeedID)** — View that reverts if the rate would not be valid (trading mode or recency); does not return the rate. Useful for pre-checks.

---

## Rate source

- **getRate(rateFeedID)** — Returns a **RateInfo** struct: `(numerator, denominator, tradingMode, isRecent, isFXMarketOpen)` without reverting. The actual rate comes from `sortedOracles.medianRate(rateFeedID)`. In current Mento V3 deployments, that path is Chainlink-backed. The adapter normalizes the denominator (SortedOracles uses 1e24; the adapter exposes 1e18 after scaling).  
  So the pool always gets the rate via the **validity-gated** path (`getFXRateIfValid`), not the raw median.

---

## L2 sequencer

- **isL2SequencerUp(since)** — If `l2SequencerUptimeFeed` is set, returns whether the sequencer has been up for at least `since` seconds (and answer is 0). If the feed is not set, returns true. Used on L2s to avoid using stale rates right after sequencer recovery.

---

## Errors

- `FXMarketClosed` — `getFXRateIfValid` called when FX market hours say closed.  
- `TradingSuspended` — BreakerBox trading mode is not bidirectional for this feed.  
- `NoRecentRate` — Median timestamp is older than `block.timestamp - reportExpiry`.  
- `InvalidRate` — Median rate numerator or denominator is zero.
