# Smart Contracts

The Mento protocol consists of a set of smart contracts, which are deployed on the[ Celo blockchain](https://celo.org/).

Mento Core is the set of smart contracts that allows virtual pools between any mento stable asset and mento collateral asset to be traded under different pricing regimes. These contracts handle all necessary operations that enable everyone to create, exchange, and contribute to the stability of Mento stable currencies.

The contracts can be found in the mento-protocol/mento-core GitHub repository:
