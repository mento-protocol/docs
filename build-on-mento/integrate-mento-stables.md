# Integrate Mento Stables

To integrate Mento stables you need to be able to integrate the Celo blockchain, in case you are supporting on-chain transactions with your solution. Resources on how to integrate the Celo blockchain can be found here: [https://docs.celo.org/integration](https://docs.celo.org/integration).

To integrate the Mento stables, you can find the addresses [here](https://docs.mento.org/mento/developers/deployments/addresses) and more on the deployment [here](https://docs.mento.org/mento/developers/deployments).

FiatConnect makes it easy for Web3 wallets and dApps to integrate with multiple on/off ramps with a standardized API, taking the pain out of achieving global on/off ramp coverage. More information on FiatConnect can be found here: [https://fiatconnect.org/](https://fiatconnect.org/).

If you are listing Mento Stables on your exchange, you will probably need access to the Mento Platform brand assets. They can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1zKKp95wZhI_5YHz0HY2Fl90mlCCnR03T).
