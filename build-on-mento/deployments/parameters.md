# Parameters

Mento v2.0.0 contracts are configured via [Celo Governance Proposals](https://celo.stake.id/#/). The parametrization and deployment details can be found in the [Mento-Deployment](https://github.com/mento-protocol/mento-deployment) repository and in corresponding governance proposals. This [config library](https://github.com/mento-protocol/mento-deployment/blob/main/script/upgrades/MU01/Config.sol) contains the smart contract and economic parameterization.&#x20;

Since governance can change these parameters, what is deployed with this configuration is not necessarily up-to-date. Current parameterization can be accessed in the Celo block explorers with the [deployment addresses](addresses.md).&#x20;
